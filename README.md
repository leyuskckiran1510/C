# THINGS TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE USING THIS CODE
1) This code UI is completetly based on [ANSI Code Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) ; So if your terminal doesn't support
ANSI escape code sequences then everything will look  gibrish.
2) Able to understand the proper comments and make changes accordinly based on your compiler; LINUX/UNIX user have nothing to worry about everythin is fine.
3) LINUX/UNIX users don't CTRL+C during the `press()` function runtime. This may cause your current Terminal TAB act weird.
4) For window's user uncomment certern code snippts and comment others as explained in the codes. For easy search
5)      !!!WINWODS'S !!!
in your code editor it is like a checkpoint so you dont's have to go through everysingle line of comments.
