# THINGS TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE USING THIS CODE
1) This code UI is completetly based on [ANSI Code Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) ; So if your terminal doesn't support
ANSI escape code sequences then everything will look  gibrish.
2) Able to understand the proper comments and make changes accordinly based on your compiler; LINUX/UNIX user have nothing to worry about everythin is fine.
3) LINUX/UNIX users don't CTRL+C during the `press()` function runtime. This may cause your current Terminal TAB act weird.
